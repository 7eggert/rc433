# rc433
Controling 433 MHz devices (e.g. power plugs)

This program should compile on Raspberry Pi and for arduino projects. It's in a works-for-me state, detecting remotes was not needed on my Pi so it's not implemented yet (should be easy). Also it's very very hacky with respect to the remotes I support.

I included a shell script for my remotes. It serves as an example on how to use it.

You are welcome to improve this program and to send patches.
